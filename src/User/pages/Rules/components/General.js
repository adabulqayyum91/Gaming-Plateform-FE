            <p>DISCONNECTIONS & LAG</p>
            <p>LAG</p>
            <p>
              A team has 10 seconds to leave the match due to lag after
              landing/start, and it will be replayed if they can provide proof
              of lag and leaving the match For 2 vs 2 BOTH team members must
              leave within 10 seconds. If it is a cash out match and your
              opponent does not agree to replay, you must provide proof of lag
              and leave within 10 seconds, and the match will be canceled. If,
              however in that time you take damage from another player, pick up
              an item, or your opponent gets a elimination/knock the match will
              stand from that point on. If after this point a member disconnects
              from the match, the match will not be replayed or canceled.
              Enrolling in tournament/cash out matches, you agree to these
              terms. Ping is not a valid indicator of lag for us to identify lag
              we must see in-game evidence of that lag like skipping, freezing,
              rubberbanding, etc
            </p>

            <p>DISCONNECTIONS</p>

            <p>
              Disconnections 30 seconds after landing in Warzone in tournaments
              can be replayed at admins discretion if valid proof is supplied of
              the disconnection promptly after it has occurred..
              <br />
              <br />
              No replay will be issued without proof of disconnect. Your
              teammate must have left within 30 seconds after your disconnection
              in order for it to have gotten a replay.
            </p>

            <p>PROOF REQUIREMENTS</p>

            <p>
              We recommend that all proof be provided in video form. The clearer

              logos, avatars and website links. The images/information submitted
              must be appropriate. Attempting to bypass the automatic censor by
              misspelling, inserting spaces or symbols, transposing letters,
              using look-alike symbols, or any other method is not allowed.
              Teams that attempt to bypass the censor will be subject to
              penalties.
            </p>
            <p>
              8. Teams on a ladder must contain the minimum number of eligible
              players to remain active on a ladder. Teams without the minimum
              number of eligible players - especially teams that are
              &quot;abandoned&quot; - are subject to removal at the Staff&apos;s
              discretion.
            </p>

              9. Player&apos;s from outside of the region advertised for this
              ladder are not allowed to compete. Failure to compete in

              is not permitted to play until the ban is up.
            </p>

            <p>
              12. Sample reserve the right to change, modify, or adapt all rules as
              deemed appropriate in order to uphold and maintain a spirit of
              overall fairness and good sportsmanship.
            </p>

            <p>NO SHOW</p>
            <p>
              1.&nbsp;A team has 15 Minutes to show for the match with the
              correct amount of eligible players and roster as shown for the
              match; failure to do so will result in a forfeit of the match.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.&nbsp;In the situation that the opposing team does not show for
              the match, your team is to acquire valid proof of the opposing
              team not showing within the 15 Minutes offered to join the match,
              and submit a Ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Valid proof of a no-show can be described as a video
              that is at least 5 minutes, but preferably 15 minutes, showing the
              hosting team refusing to invite you. &nbsp;You must also make an
              attempt to invite your opponent and show your opponent refusing to
              join your lobby. No show proof can NOT be pictures.
            </p>
            <p>WHAT TO DO IF YOUR OPPONENT IS NO-SHOWING:</p>
            <p>
              1.&nbsp;In the event your opponent is refusing to play your match,
              you&nbsp;need to have at-least 5 to 15 minutes of video
              proof&nbsp;showing that you are trying to invite him/her and/or
              are attempting to get in contact with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.&nbsp;After the forfeit time, please uplaod your video proof and
              submit it in a dispute ticket. Your ticket will be handled in
              order it is received in.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              3.&nbsp;If you are uploading your proof on YouTube, FaceBook, or
              any other website, please make sure the video isn&apos;t on
              private and your privacy settings allow us to look at it.
            </p>

            <p>CHEATING</p>
            <p>Hacks</p>
            <p>
              If a team is found to be using hacks, the whole roster will be
              punished, up to a ban from the website forever.
            </p>
            <p>Communication</p>
            <p>
              1. The use of any communications other than what is provided
              within the game is strictly prohibited. There are exceptions to
              this rule in which outside communication can be utilized. These
              exceptions include, but are not limited to: games that give you no
              advantage by using outside communication, games that do not have
              an in-game voice option, and games in which the rules specifically
              state that outside communication is allowed.
            </p>
            <p>Cheating in Matches</p>
            <p>
              1. Sample has a zero tolerance policy for cheating; teams caught
              cheating, &ldquo;glitching,&rdquo; or abusing in-game mechanics in
              any way will be removed from Sample.
            </p>

            <p>PROOF</p>
            <p>Acquiring Proof</p>
            <p>
              1. Proof may be acquired by recording situations and all matches.
              Keep in mind, may the situation arise where a dispute is made by
              the opposing team, and you are unable to provide valid proof of
              winning the previous match, you risk the match being cancelled. It
              is suggested to all users of Sample to obtain valid proof, disputed
              or not, to be safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. All proof must be recorded an uploaded using the console&apos;s
              (Xbox One / PS4) &quot;share&quot; system; keep in mind, if a
              dispute occurs and there is not a direct upload from the
              console&apos;s share system, the user risks the match being
              cancelled. PVR Proof is accepted, but the console share system is
              the preferred method of accepted proof. If you are unable to paste
              your share system link into the provided proof slot in the ticket
              center, we suggest putting the link into a URL Shortener and using
              that link in your ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. If you do not use the consoles DVR feature, you risk your proof
              being considered &quot;Insufficient&quot;.
              We&nbsp;HIGHLY&nbsp;suggest you use your consoles DVR feature for
              proof.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. If you are unsure what proof to gather in a certain situation,
              visit our live-support and we will be glad to assist you!
            </p>

            <p>Submitting Proof</p>
            <p>
              1. When submitting proof, you must post the direct URL in the
              ticket. It is not the responsibility of a Sample Staff Member to go
              outside of the direct link provided to search for the proof
              attempting to be submitted.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. For proof to be considered valid, it must have the full
              scoreboard with gamertags, with the proof being clear enough for
              Staff to read it. Keep in mind, if valid proof is not provided, as
              it is the users primary responsibility to be sure it is in a
              Ticket, the proof provided that does not meet these standards will
              be considered &ldquo;Insufficient&rdquo; for the match.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Submitting fake, irrelevant, or old proof may result in a
              temporary suspension from Sample.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Any conversation may not be considered valid proof; this
              includes, but is not limited to: Twitter conversations, PMs, AIMs,
              Skype, or messages through Xbox Live or Playstation Network. This
              means,&nbsp;messages are NOT a form of valid proof.
            </p>
            <p>Valid Proof</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  No Shows&nbsp;- For no-show proof to be valid,
                  it&nbsp;MUST&nbsp;be at-least 5 to 15 minutes long in a video
                  form.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Forfeit (Wrong Rules)&nbsp;- For wrong rule proof to be valid,
                  it&nbsp;MUST&nbsp;be in a video form. In the video, it needs
                  to show what rule is wrong, and the&nbsp;FULL&nbsp;scoreboard
                  so we can verify the gamertags. In your ticket, explain what
                  rule is wrong.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Forfeit (Illegal Items)&nbsp;- If you are forfeiting someone
                  for using illegal items (whether it&apos;s a perk, banend gun,
                  ect) we highly suggest it be in a video form as it&apos;s less
                  likely to be marked as invalid. It needs to clearly show them
                  what they are using, and the full screoboard/gamertags. In the
                  ticket, explain what illegal item they are using.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additional Information</p>
            <p>
              1)&nbsp;ALWAYS! Put the last four digits of the match ID in your
              clan tag. This makes it so people cannot use old proof against
              you.
            </p>
            <p>
              2)&nbsp;If your video is longer than five minutes long, please
              provide time-stamps of what you are claiming is happening in the
              video for the admin. Without that, your proof may be marked as
              invalid.
            </p>
            <p>
              3)&nbsp;Video proof is prefered rather than screenshots. In the
              event that video proof is provided by one team, and screenshots by
              the other, staff members have the right to side with the video
              proof.
            </p>

            <p>REPORTING/DISPUTING</p>
            <p>Reporting&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
              1. It is the responsibility of all teams involved in a match to
              report scores. Teams must report the match within 2 Hours of
              completion. If a team reports within 2 Hours and the opposing team
              fails to do so, the outcome will be determined by the reporting
              team. &nbsp;The match outcome will NOT be overturned.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Teams found reporting the win for no reason will result in a
              forfeit of the match and will risk suspension from Sample for
              Disputing on Purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Reporting a match before it has been played is&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;a
              forfeit. &nbsp;If a team reports their win or a match issue prior
              to the match being played and that team loses, they are required
              to submit a ticket under the category &quot;Accept Loss&quot;.
              &nbsp;Not doing so may also result in a suspension from Sample for
              Disputing on Purpose. If your opponent reports a match issue prior
              to the match being played, you are still responsible for gathering
              proof of your claims (ex: no show).
            </p>
            <p>
              4. If you report the loss for your team, we
              will&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;reverse or cancel the match. It is the
              responsibility of the reporter to report the correct score.

            <p>Disputing</p>
            <p>
              1. If a Dispute occurs, teams must submit a Ticket with valid
              proof of their claims; more information on how to acquire and
              submit proof can be found in the &ldquo;Proof&rdquo; section
              above. If a team does not submit a ticket in the provided 2 hour
              time period, they are risking receiving the loss for the
              match.&nbsp;&nbsp;The match outcome will NOT be overturned if a
              ticket is submitted late or not submitted at all
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Teams with 3 or more Disputes pending to be answered will be
              locked until the Disputes have been resolved.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. When disputing, you&nbsp;MUST&nbsp;have proof to back up your
              claims. You cannot dispute a match without providing valid proof.
              If you do not have proof to support your claims, you
              should&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;dispute the match. Disputing the match
              without providing valid proof will result in you getting banned
              for disputing on purpose.

              should not be contacted regarding any Tickets that have been

              Dispute, is to be submitted if all steps to find a right decision
              is made and the user is unsatisfied with a Sample Staff Member.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Teams must report the match within 2 Hours of completion. If a
              team reports within 2 Hours and the opposing team fails to do so,

              the same rule applies for Tickets being submitted for the match
              being disputed.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Teams found reporting the win for no reason and found abusing
              the times offered will result in a forfeit of the match and will

              need to either escalate the ticket, or respond to the ticket
              asking the admin for an explanation. If they made a wrong call and
              they notice it, they will change the incorrect call. Otherwise,
              they will explain to you why you received the loss or a cancel.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Submitting additional ticktes after a call has been made may
              result in a 3 day ban for ticket spam.

              the other participant has 30 minutes&nbsp;to Verify or Dispute the
              match report. If the results are not Verified or Disputed, the

              Should a match go unreported within 75 minutes of it being

              Any rule not stated in the pregame rules will be considered
              invalid and not an enforceable rule for the match.&nbsp;All agreed
              upon rules apply to both parties unless the agreed upon rules
              specifically state otherwise. Any rule that does not pertain to
              game play for the match that is set up is not an enforceable rule.

              <br />
              Glitches or actions that manipulate the basic functions of the

              advantage without an agreement or acknowledgement by both players
              pregame it will result in a forfeit. If you customize the standard
              online rosters in any way without informing your opponent pregame
              it can result in an unfavorable decision.&nbsp;

              Some games lag and that it is not ideal for game play.&nbsp;Unless

              be little to no advantage for either party and evidence is
              provided of the claimed lag the game will have to be played out.
              We have no grounds to take a lead or win off the board when both
              players are playing at the same disadvantage. If someone is found
              to be intentionally lagging it will result in an automatic loss.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you do not agree with a pregame setting or the team being used,

              If you intentionally exit a match while losing or the game is tied

            <p>
              Claiming a win while in game and the outcome still in the balance
              can result in an unfavorable decision. If the game is played to a
              point where we deem the game to be in hand the score is what will
              be enforced. If your opponent claims a win while in game and you
              continue to play past that point, your claim will automatically be
              considered invalid.

              If a player proves a rule to be broken by their opponent at a
              point where they are winning the match, the match is tied, or
              within one score and the match is exited immediately, the player

              If the match is played past the point the rule was violated or to
              a point the game is in hand and the evidence is sent in the match
              will be considered a draw and all money will be returned to the
              participants less the Sample fee unless the evidence provided shows
